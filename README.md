# ChatGPT-Voice-Assistant

This repository contains code for a Voice Assistant based on the OpenAI GPT model. It uses speech recognition to convert spoken language into text, and text-to-speech to convert the AI responses back into spoken language.

    git clone https://github.com/mSakib20/ChatGPT-Voice-Assistant.git

## Usage:

To start the Voice Assistant, simply run the Python script:

    python chatGPT_assistant.py

You'll then be able to interact with the assistant by speaking, and it will respond vocally using the generated AI responses.

## Dependencies:

This project relies on several Python libraries, including:

- speech_recognition for converting spoken language into text
- pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion
- openai to interact with the GPT model

Ensure that you have these installed in your Python environment before running the script.
